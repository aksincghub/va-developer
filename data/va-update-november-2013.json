Research shows that these treatments provide the best results for most patients with those conditions. Hospitals, doctors, scientists, and other health care professionals agree that these quality measures give a good snapshot of the quality of care that hospitals give. Hospitals should try to give all of their patients the recommended care when it is appropriate. The goal for each measure is 100 percent.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) releases the quality goals and measured performance of VA health care in order to ensure public accountability and to spur constant improvements in health care delivery. The success of this approach is reflected in our receipt of the Annual Leadership Award from the American College of Medical Quality.\n\nMuch of the data in LinKS and ASPIRE are simply not measured in other health systems - VA is raising the bar. When available, VA uses outside benchmarks but often sets VA standards or goals at a higher level. VA scores hospitals more than 30% different from the goal as underperforming or red and those only 10% different from the goal are shown in green in ASPIRE. But a red site within the VA might be a good performer compared to outside counterparts. The scoring system is designed to move VA forward. ASPIRE is not about finding fault",
